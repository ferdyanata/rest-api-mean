# rest-api-mean
Creating a REST API using the MEAN stack

# dependencies
**express**
> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.   

# dev dependencies
**nodemon**
To install as a dev dependency:
npm install nodemon --save-dev
> nodemon reloads the server each time it finds changes in the file. Doing so removes the need to run node index each time there are file changes.
