Open another CLI tab after installing nodemon as a dev dependency, type in npx nodemon.

# Software and Tools used
**RoboMongo**
>RoboMongo/Robo 3T is a GUI for MongoDB

# Stack
MongoDB, Express and NodeJS

# dependencies
**express**
> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.

**mongoose**
> Adds a layer of methods fo easily save, edit, retrieve and delete data from mongodb. Also allows us to create our Models and Schemas easily.

# dev dependencies
**nodemon**
To install as a dev dependency:
npm install nodemon --save-dev
> nodemon reloads the server each time it finds changes in the file. Doing so removes the need to run node index each time there are file changes.
